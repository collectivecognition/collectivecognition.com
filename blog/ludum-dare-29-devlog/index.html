			<h2>Ludum Dare 29 Devlog</h2>
			<h4>Posted on 25 April 2014 by William Blanchette</h4>
			<p><h2 id="pm-initial-ideas">9:05PM: Initial Ideas</h2>

<p>The theme is Beneath The Surface. My initial thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Asteroid mining (something like Dig Dug or Mr Driller?)</li>
  <li>Ocean exploration (fishing?)</li>
  <li>Oil drilling (a puzzle game maybe?)</li>
  <li>Peeling vegetables (could be a good use of touch controls!)</li>
  <li>Exploring the human psyche (psychologist simulator?)</li>
  <li>Crypt / tombs / catacombs (filling up with water maybe?)</li>
  <li>Mine carts (procedurally generated tunnels?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pm-choosing-an-idea">9:22PM: Choosing An Idea</h2>

<p>There were a lot of space-type themes in the final list so I was already thinking along these lines before the final theme was chosen.</p>

<p>I think I have to go with asteroid mining. I’m imagining something like a combination of Lunar Lander and the classic Asteroids. Unity should be able to handle most of the physics “heavy lifting” and as long as I stick to a simple graphical style, I think I might be able to pull this off.</p>

<p>Some initial thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want this to work on mobile devices, so touch-friendly controls are a must. </li>
  <li>I’d like travel between asteroids to be zoomed out, with the camera zooming in for landing</li>
  <li>Parallax stars would be cool for the background</li>
</ul>

<p>Time to start coding!</p>

<h2 id="pm-basic-physics--controls">10:22PM: Basic Physics / Controls</h2>

<p>I’ve got a placeholder ship sprite and a basic newtonian physics control setup which allows attitude adjustment (rotation) forward / reverse thrust and velocity clamping to keep things sane.</p>

<pre><code>using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class ShipControls : MonoBehaviour {
	private float rotatationSpeed = 100.0f;
	private float acceleration = 2.0f;
	private float thrust = 0.0f;
	private float maxVelocity = 2.0f;

	void Update(){
		transform.Rotate (Vector3.forward * (-Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * rotatationSpeed * Time.deltaTime) ); 

		float inputThrust = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
		thrust += inputThrust * acceleration;

		Vector3 newForce = Vector3.up * thrust * Time.deltaTime;
		Vector3 relativeForce = transform.InverseTransformDirection(newForce);
		rigidbody2D.AddForce(new Vector2(relativeForce.x * -1f, relativeForce.y));

		rigidbody2D.velocity = Vector3.ClampMagnitude(rigidbody2D.velocity, maxVelocity);

		Debug.DrawLine (transform.position, transform.position + Vector3.up * 2f, Color.red);
	}

	void OnGUI(){
		GUI.Label(new Rect(10, 10, 100, 25), "Thrust: " + thrust);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="pm-wrestling-with-blog">10:40PM: Wrestling With Blog</h2>

<p>Grr! My blog publishing scripts are giving me trouble. Mental note: sort this sort of thing out BEFORE the compo next time.</p>

<h2 id="pm-so-very-tired">11:05PM: So Very Tired</h2>

<p>I’ve done some more “miner” tweaking, but as it’s been a very long day and I’m having trouble keeping my eyes open, I think I’ll get some sleep and hit the ground running in the morning.</p>

<p>A few notes on my current thoughts for the direction of the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Randomly place asteroids around level</li>
  <li>Place “ore” nuggets randomly within asteroids</li>
  <li>Ship must fly by and scan for these ore nuggest</li>
  <li>After locating an ore nugget, player must land on asteroid surface perpendicular to nugget and drill straight down to retrieve it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="am-wakey-wakey">6:58AM: Wakey Wakey</h2>

<p>My significant other had a brilliant idea in her dreams: Beaneath the Surfers, a game about surfers avoiding being eaten by sharks. If only LD was twice as long!</p>

<p>Back to work :D</p>

<h2 id="am-camera">8:07AM: Camera</h2>

<p>I’ve made a bit of progress with an auto-zooming camera that makes sure you can always see at least one asteroid. It’s glitchy, but basically functional so I’m going to shift gears and work on some scanning code.</p>

<pre><code>public class Asteroid : MonoBehaviour {
	public bool IsVisible(){
		Vector3 viewPos = Camera.main.WorldToViewportPoint(transform.position);

		if(viewPos.x &lt; 0 || viewPos.x &gt; 1 || viewPos.y &lt; 0 || viewPos.y &gt; 1){
			return false;
		}

		return true;
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="am-scanner">9:20AM: Scanner</h2>

<p>I have a basic scanner system in place. Scanner is triggered by holding down the mouse button and then aimed with the mouse. Ore that is “scanned” will become visible.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/original/ludum-dare-29-2.jpg" rel="shadowbox"><img src="/images/blog/thumbnails/ludum-dare-29-2.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2 id="am-level-generation">10:40AM: Level Generation</h2>

<p>Lots of tweaks / additions in the last hour.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implemented a basic level generator that places asteroids and adds ore to them.</li>
  <li>Re-wrote camera zooming system to simply toggle between zoom levels based on the distance the closest asteroid. This works MUCH better than the more elaborate system.</li>
  <li>Tweaked ship controls to make the physics more manageable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next task will be adding support for landing on asteroids (and destroying the ship if you come in too fast / upside down /etc..), which is probably going to be one of the trickiest bits of code in the game.</p>

<p>All in all, things are progressing nicely and I have decent confidence I’ll be able to finish SOMETHING to submit tomorrow.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/original/ludum-dare-29-3.jpg" rel="shadowbox"><img src="/images/blog/thumbnails/ludum-dare-29-3.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2 id="am-lunch-break">11:32AM: Lunch Break!</h2>

<p>I got a little distracted and added animated thrusters to indicate the direction / intensity of thrust and also tweaked the physics a bit.</p>

<p>Most of the core mechanics are in place, except “mining” the ore and collisions, so I think this is a good stopping point to take a break and go grab some lunch.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/original/ludum-dare-29-4.jpg" rel="shadowbox"><img src="/images/blog/thumbnails/ludum-dare-29-4.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2 id="pm-lots-of-updates">2:24PM: Lots of Updates</h2>

<p>Had a nice long lunch (Korean pork bone soup) and then got a ton of work done!</p>

<p>Highlights are a bunch of graphics updates, including parallax backgrounds and new asteroids.</p>

<p>I also re-wrote the ore distribution code to place the ore realistically beneath the uneven surface of the asteroids by picking. Quick code sample to illustrate the technique:</p>

<pre><code>public class Asteroid : MonoBehaviour {
	public GameObject orePrefab;

	private float minDepth = 0.1f;
	private float maxDepth = 0.5f;
	private int minOre = 2;
	private int maxOre = 20;

	// Initialize a new asteroid

	public void Start(){

		// Generate a random number of ore, within the specified range

		int numOre = Random.Range(minOre, maxOre);

		for(int ii = 0; ii &lt; numOre; ii++){

			// Instantiate a new ore object and parent it to the asteroid

			GameObject ore = (GameObject)Instantiate(orePrefab);
			ore.transform.parent = gameObject.transform;

			// Pick a random point along the outside of the asteroid collider

			PolygonCollider2D p = (PolygonCollider2D)collider2D;
			Vector2 randomPoint = p.points[Random.Range (0, p.points.Length)];

			// Move it to a random depth in the specified range

			float randomDepth = Random.Range(minDepth, maxDepth);
			randomPoint = Vector2.Lerp(randomPoint, Vector2.zero, randomDepth);

			// Set position of ore, making sure to place it's z in front of the asteroid

			Vector3 randomPos = new Vector3(randomPoint.x, randomPoint.y, -0.0001f);
			ore.transform.localPosition = randomPos;
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="pm-slow-going">4:19PM: Slow Going</h2>

<p>Physics are turning into a pain in the butt (as per usual), so I’ve wasted a good amount of time tweaking those and I’ms till not 100% happy with the controls.</p>

<p>I did manage to throw in a nice explosion animation when the ship collides with an asteroid and a system for breaking the ship up into it’s component parts and applying random forces to them so they drift / spin away during the explosion. It looks pretty cool!</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/original/ludum-dare-29-6.jpg" rel="shadowbox"><img src="/images/blog/thumbnails/ludum-dare-29-6.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2 id="pm-more-tweaking">5:04PM: More Tweaking</h2>

<p>I’ve finally got the physics and controls in a place I’m happy with, and a solid idea of where I want the rest of the gameplay to go.</p>

<p>I’m going to replace the scanning beam with more of a “pulse” which gets sent out in all directions at intervals. The scanning beam will be repurposed as a sort of mining tractor beam and become the mechanism by which the player retrives ore.</p>

<p>Time to think about some dinner, do a few errands around the house and finish plotting my next steps.</p>

<h2 id="pm-scanning">7:06PM: Scanning</h2>

<p>I’ve revamped the scanning system and played with a lot of the graphics and small subsystems. Things are going slowly but surely. I think I’ll be able to have all the core gameplay finished before I go to bed, leaving all day tomorrow for polishing, playtesting, sound effects and finishing touches like menus, etc..</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/original/ludum-dare-29-7.jpg" rel="shadowbox"><img src="/images/blog/thumbnails/ludum-dare-29-7.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2 id="pm-version-control">8:30PM: Version Control</h2>

<p>Remember, friends don’t let friends develop without using version control! Set up a git repo for the project so I can start tracking changes after a small scare with some changes causing a nasty crash.</p>

<p>The mining beam is coming along nicely, should have a working prototype soon.</p>

<h2 id="pm-mining-beam">9:37PM: Mining Beam</h2>

<p>My first stab at the mining beam is complete, as well as some basic score-keeping. The game now officially meets the definition a game, being that it has a beginning, a middle and an end.</p>

<p>I think I’m in good shape to get this thing into decent shape for submission by the deadline tomorrow., so I’ll probably slow down a bit for the rest of the evening, but I’ll likely chip away at a few small things before bed.</p>

<h2 id="am-late-start">10:06AM: Late Start</h2>

<p>Had a little bit of a sleep in and then had to do some grocery shopping, so I’m starting later than I wanted to. Fortunately, I have a pretty good idea of how to tackle the last few features so hopefully things will progress quickly today.</p>

<p>Also, Sarah helped me come up with a name for the game: Ursa Miner.</p>

<h2 id="am-mini-map">10:51AM: Mini Map</h2>

<p>I’m working through my wish list of extra features now. First up: a mini map. This was pretty easy to pull off using a second camera, although there were some difficulties with converting between real and normalized screen coordinates, rendering order of GUI elements vs game objects, etc.. I think it looks really slick for such a small amount of work!</p>
