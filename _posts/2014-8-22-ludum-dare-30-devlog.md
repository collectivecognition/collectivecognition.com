8:30PM: Waiting...
------------------

1. Blog post started. Check.
2. Latest version of Unity installed. Check.

Now to wait for the theme to be announced!

8:00AM: Beginnings
------------------

I brainstormed until about 11 last night and landed on a few vague ideas, but decided it would be better to get a fresh start in the morning.

After having a nice sleep I've decided on a nautical theme, with the player sailing between islands / continents. Think the Old World and the New World, connecting them with seafaring trade routes.

I'm going to try to keep the look of the game as simple as possible so I can concentrate on the core gameplay, physics, etc.. Behold, the very first screenshot! Doesn't look like much, but I've got some basic buoyancy physics going which I think look pretty decent in action.

9:00AM: Quick Update
--------------------

Just a quick update to show some progress in the graphical style. I've pretty much decided on a wind movement mechanic which I'm going to start on as soon as I get back from doing some grocery shopping.

11:30AM: Wind!
--------------

I've made a bit of progress on a wind system and added some basic manual controls.

3:30PM: Slow Progress
---------------------

The game is progressing slowly but I'm definitely making progress. I've got some basic world generation to generate random islands, a simple ship model with simulated cloth sails and have made a bunch of tweaks to the controls and the physics.

Next up will be adding some user interface stuff so I can start to flesh out some actual gameplay.

5:00PM: UI Work
----------------

I've updated to Unity 4.6 to get access to the new UI system, which burned a bit of time. On the up side, it's MUCH easier to get up and running than the old system so I think I'll make up the lost time with increased efficiency.

I designed added an event dialog which will enable a lot of the gameplay features I'm planning to be added rapidly.

Time for a short dinner / excercise break!
