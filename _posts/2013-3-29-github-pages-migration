This site has been languishing of late and I have lots of things I'd like to add. Mostly this is due to the fact that I've grown apart from Wordpress and cringe a little whenever I think about all the steps involved in making changes to the existing site.

Today I migrated the site over to Github pages, using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a lot like my Cushion framework, but obviously more mature and widely supported, with a wealth of plugins and other tidbits to borrow when I'm feeling lazy.

Updates are now a simple matter of opening up my <a href"http://panic.com/coda">favorite text editor</a>, writing a text (or markdown, or HTML) file, and doing a git push.

Expect to see more frequent updates as I start posting all the stuff I've been working on.
