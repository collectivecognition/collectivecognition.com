I've posted the first version of colour.js to [github](http://github.com/collectivecognition/colour.js).

It's a javascript library (actually just a single class) for converting and playing with colour values. It lets you do things like this:

    var colour = new Colour(el.style.backgroundColor);
    el.style.backgroundColor = colour.l(colour.l() - 0.1);
    
which will lighten the background colour of the element by 10%.

The library handles parsing, manipulating and outputting colours in hex, rgb, rgba, hsl and hsla currently, with planned support for w3d colour names in the future.
