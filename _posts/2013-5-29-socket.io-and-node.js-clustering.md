I ran into a problem while working on chat.js, in the form of alot of log-spam from socket.io that looked something like this:

	info  - handshake authorized DL6P-B6mDjt1hrhM3VYw
	debug - setting request GET /socket.io/1/websocket/DL6P-B6mDjt1hrhM3VYw
	debug - set heartbeat interval for client DL6P-B6mDjt1hrhM3VYw
	debug - websocket writing 7:::1+0
	warn  - client not handshaken client should reconnect
	info  - transport end (error)
	debug - set close timeout for client DL6P-B6mDjt1hrhM3VYw
	debug - cleared close timeout for client DL6P-B6mDjt1hrhM3VYw
	debug - cleared heartbeat interval for client DL6P-B6mDjt1hrhM3VYw
	debug - discarding transport
	
The problem turned out to be due to my use of the (still experimental) `cluster` API  causing a race condition in socket.io and causing erratic behaviour in my application.

Luckily, multiple-cpu support isn't a huge requirement for me at this time. Just a heads up for anyone else having similar problems.
